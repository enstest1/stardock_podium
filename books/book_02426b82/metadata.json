  "description": "<div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 600\">An all-new novel based upon the explosive <em>Star Trek</em> TV series!</p>\n<p>In a desperate attempt to prevent the artificial intelligence known as Control from seizing crucial information that could destroy all sentient life, Commander Michael Burnham donned the \u201cRed Angel\u201d time-travel suit and guided the USS <em>Discovery</em> into the future and out of harm\u2019s way. But something has gone terribly wrong, and Burnham has somehow arrived in a place far different from anything she could have imagined\u2014more than nine hundred years out of her time, with <em>Discovery</em> nowhere to be found, and where the mysterious and cataclysmic event known as \u201cthe Burn\u201d has utterly decimated Starfleet and, with it, the United Federation of Planets. How then can she possibly exist day-to-day in this strange place? What worlds are out there waiting to be discovered? Do any remnants of Starfleet and the Federation possibly endure? With more questions than answers, Burnham must nevertheless forge new friendships and new alliances if she hopes to survive this future long enough for the <em>Discovery</em> crew to find her....</p>\n<p>\u2122, \u00ae, &amp; \u00a9 2021 CBS Studios, Inc.
